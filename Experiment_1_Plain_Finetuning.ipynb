well-known Kingfisher lager brand, and make a public offer to buy another 20% stake.In 2002 S&N and United agreed to form a strategic partnership, one that would include a joint venture business and a

invest 2.47bn rupees in United through non-convertible redeemable preference shares.Meanwhile, United's budget airline, Kingfisher Airlines, is to buy 10 A320 aircraft from Airbus and has the option

million records worldwide, were written and recorded in English.The premiere marks Abba's first public reunion since the legendary band's acrimonious break-up in the early 1980s.The original stars of

Anni-Frid Lyngstad, have met publicly.\", 'Labour has been accused of using anti-Semitic images in posters which critics claim depict Tory leader Michael Howard as Fagin.Mr Howard did not comment on the anti-Semitism claims when asked about the poster on Monday.The image simply portrayed Mr Howard as a hypnotist, he argued.Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said the poster had been misunderstood.The poster shows Mr Howard hypnotising people with a pocket watch, saying: \"I can spend the same money twice.\"It showed Mr Howard and Mr Letwin - who are both Jewish - as flying pigs.Mr Howard told Greater Manchester Radio: \"It is such a pity that Mr Blair doesn\\'t practise what he preaches.\"A Labour spokesman later said the timing of removing the controversial image from the party\\'s website was not affected by the row.There was controversy over another poster choice offered to Labour members.Jewish Chronicle editor Ned Temko said there had been a mixed reaction to the first poster but e-mails from Jewish Chronicle readers showed deeper concern about the hypnotism image.', 'It emerged that Mutu had failed a drugs test on October 18 and, although it was initially reported that the banned substance in question was cocaine.Chelsea have sacked Adrian Mutu after he failed a drugs test.\"In coming to a decision on this case, Chelsea believed the club\\'s social responsibility to its fans, players, employees and other stakeholders in football regarding drugs was more important than the major financial considerations to the company.The Football Association has yet to act on Mutu\\'s failed drugs test and refuses to discuss his case.\"It is a very clear stance by Chelsea and it has given a strong boost to the reputation of the club.\"A statement from Chelsea explaining the decision read:\"We want to make clear that Chelsea has a zero tolerance policy towards drugs.\"\"Any player who takes drugs breaches his contract with the club as well as Football Association rules.\"It was a very difficult decision for them and an expensive decision for them but the terms of his contract were breached and it was the only decision they could make.And the sport\\'s world governing body has re-iterated their stance over Mutu\\'s failed drugs test, maintaining it is a matter for the domestic sporting authorities.', 'He highlighted technology trends over the last year that had driven the need to make technology and transferring content across difference devices \"seamless\".Mr Gates said that a lot of work had been done in the last year to sort out usability and compatibility issues between devices to make it easier to share content.Several partnerships with device and hardware manufacturers were highlighted during Mr Gates\\' speech, but there were few major groundbreaking new technology announcements.Bill Gates has opened the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, saying that gadgets are working together more to help people manage multimedia content around the home and on the move.\"It is the way all these devices work together which will make the difference,\" he said.Mr Gates said the PC, like Microsoft\\'s Media Centre, had a central role to play in how people would be making the most out of audio, video and images but it would not be the only device.The latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition TVs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies will all be on show over the three days.That trend is predicted to continue with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005.Mr Gates made no announcement about the next generation Xbox games console, which many gadget lovers had been hoping for.The game, which makes use of the Xbox Live online games service, has sold 6.23 million copies since its release.', \"US mortgage company Fannie Mae should restate its earnings, a move that is likely to put a billion-dollar dent in its accounts, watchdogs have said.The SEC's comments are likely to increase pressure on Congress to strengthen supervision of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.The other main US mortgage firm Freddie Mac restated earnings by $5bn (£2.6bn) last year after a probe of its books.Fannie Mae last month warned that some records were incorrect.\", \"Elvis' single Jailhouse Rock

SonyBMG are releasing Elvis' 18 number one singles at the rate of one a week in Britain, complete with original artwork and a collector's box.Jailhouse Rock is now the 999th number one single in UK pop history.\", 'During a question and answer session with first-time voters on Five News, Mr Blair said he had no option but to \"confront it\" by talking to people.In answer to a question from 22-year-old Liverpool student David Dunne about concerns over the prime minister\\'s personal integrity, Mr Blair said talking was the only answer.He was not \"forcing\" anyone to go to university, but places should be there for those who wanted them, he said.He insisted there was no plan for an invasion of the country saying: \"Sometimes people say because of what has happened in Iraq this is the next place.\"By talking through policies at least people understood the reason for them, even if they did not agree with them, he said.', 'Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez said their qualification for the next stage of the Champions League was \"one of the proudest nights of my career.\"The Reds beat Olympiakos 3-1 with a late Steven Gerrard strike and Benitez said: \"It was a really great night.\"We knew before the game that it was very important for the club to gain these extra finances.It was a massive night for me and the team.\"Gerrard admitted he thought they were going out of the Champions League after trailing 1-0 at half-time.Benitez hailed Gerrard for his match-winning strike four minutes from time and also the Anfield crowd for sticking by their side after they had fallen a goal behind at the interval.\"I have said to him many times that he has the freedom because he has talent and is very important to us.', 'BT is introducing two initiatives to help beat rogue dialler scams, which can cost dial-up net users thousands.Inadvertently downloaded by surfers, rogue diallers are programs which hijack modems and dial up a premium rate number when users log on.Icstis, the UK\\'s premium rate services watchdog, said it had been looking for companies to take the lead in initiatives.There are legitimate companies who offer services such as adult content, sports results and music downloads by charging a premium rate rather than by credit card BT said it had ploughed an enormous amount of effort into protecting people from the problem.The second initiative BT announced is an early warning system which will alert BT customers if there is unusual activity on their phone bills.From May, dial-up net users will be able to download free software to stop computers using numbers not on a user\\'s \"pre-approved list\".The watchdog brought in the action last October following a decision to license all companies which wanted to operate legitimate premium rate dialler services.It has already barred more than 1,000 premium rate numbers and has tried to raise public awareness about the scams.', '\"I can confirm that BaFin has passed through the case to the public prosecutor,\" a BaFin spokeswoman said.\"We are disappointed that the BaFin has referred to the prosecutor the question of whether action should be brought against individuals involved,\" Citigroup said.Traders at US banking giant Citigroup are facing a criminal investigation in Germany over a controversial bond deal.Germany\\'s financial watchdog BaFin told BBC News it had now transferred the investigation to the public prosecutor.However, under German criminal law, prosecutors cannot pursue Citigroup itself.The move was widely criticised at the time, and now the German regulator has said it has found evidence of possible market manipulation.', \"The charity single by Band Aid 20 has held on the chart top spot for a second week, strengthening its chances of becoming the Christmas number one.Opera band Il Divo have moved up one place with their eponymous album to number three.Maroon 5's album Songs About Jane has moved up to number seven despite being released 47 weeks ago.U2's How to Dismantle a Bomb remains at number one for a third week in a row, followed by Williams' Greatest Hits.\", 'Ms Khan said the movement had failed to mobilise public outrage about what was happening to the human rights system.\"The human rights movement faces a crisis of faith in the value of human rights,\" she said.\"By using the language of war, human rights are being sidelined because we know human rights do not apply in times of war.\"Ms Khan said the human rights movement would make itself irrelevant if it turned away from the suffering caused by economic strife.She said the human rights movement had to use simpler language both to prevent scepticism and spread a moral message.\"Public passivity on the war against terror is the single most powerful indictment on the failures of human rights groups,\" she said.The lack of public outrage about the war on terror is a powerful indictment of the failure of human rights groups, Amnesty International\\'s chief has said.\"What\\'s a new challenge is the way in which this age-old debate on security and human rights has been translated into the language of war,\" she said.The Amnesty secretary-general said a growing gap between the perceived influence of human rights group and what they could actually achieve was fuelling scepticism.', 'The fee could put Liverpool off a prospective deal but Real are keen to net the cash as they are reported to be preparing a massive summer bid for Inter Milan striker Adriano.The Real Madrid striker has been linked with a move to Anfield since the summer and is currently behind Raul, Ronaldo and Michael Owen at the Bernabeu.I\\'m under contract to Real and they will make any decisions.\"\"If there is an attractive propostition it could be I would be keen to leave,\" admitted the 28-year-old Morientes.', 'The Cellery worm installs a playable version of the classic falling blocks game on PCs that it has infected.While users play the game, the worm spends its time using the machine to search for new victims to infect on nearby networks.When it infects a machine, Cellery installs a version of Tetris that users can play.The risk of infection by Cellery is thought to be very low as few copies of the worm have been found in the wild.At the same time the virus starts scouring networks for other vulnerable machines.As the game starts up the worm also starts a music file to accompany it.']\n"]}],"source":["# stitch article summaries from data together, get one list with all the masked summaries available\n","# problem:

Faltskog has been a virtual recluse since the band split up in 1982. The musical, which has become a global phenomenon, will be performed in Swedish for the first time. Fans camped outside Stockholm's Cirkus theatre in the snow for a glimpse of the stars. The premiere marks Abba's first public reunion since the legendary band's acrimonious break-up in the early 1980s. It was thought that Faltskog would appear in London for the musical's fifth anniversary celebrations in April 2004 but she stayed away due to her fear of flying.\\n\\nOriginal Abba member Bjorn Ulvaeus set about translating the musical into the band's mother tongue for the celebrated homecoming, alongside Swedish artist Niklas Stromstedt. Almost all of Abba's original songs, which have sold more than 350 million records worldwide, were written and recorded in English. The musical, set on a small Greek island, tells of the story of a young woman and her fiercely independent single mother. The show will include such classics as Super Trouper, SOS and Dancing Queen.

Labour later took the image off its website, saying an alternative idea had proved more popular with party members. The party will now use focus groups to test a poster showing Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin with a blackboard reading: \"2+2=5\".\\n\\nThe hypnotism poster has been compared to the portrayal of the Dickens character Fagin in the stage version of the musical Oliver! There was controversy over another poster choice offered to Labour members. It showed Mr Howard and Mr Letwin - who are both Jewish - as flying pigs. Mr Howard did not comment on the anti-Semitism claims when asked about the poster on Monday. Instead, he pointed to how Tony Blair had in 1997 complained about \"personalised abusive campaigning\". Mr Howard told Greater Manchester Radio: \"It is such a pity that Mr Blair doesn\\'t practise what he preaches.\"\\n\\nJewish Chronicle editor Ned Temko said there had been a mixed reaction to the first poster but e-mails from Jewish Chronicle readers showed deeper concern about the hypnotism image. \"Shylock and Fagin are inextricably linked to notions of centuries-old prejudice,\" he told BBC Radio 4\\'s World At One. \"Whatever the idea is, I think it\\'s a difficult exercise to use images like that and to argue that you can divorce them from their historical context or meaning.\" Mr Temko said he blamed \"cock-up not conspiracy\", saying he did not detect inherent anti-Semitism in any of the parties\\' election campaigns.\\n\\nThe poster is among one of a series of ideas shown to Labour members, who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election. Labour MP Louise Ellman said the hypnotism image was insensitive but urged people not to rush to call things anti-Semitic when they only challenged Tory economic policies. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said the poster had been misunderstood.

Sophos urged users and companies to update their anti-virus software to keep themselves protected.\\n', 'summary': 'The Cellery worm installs a playable version of the classic falling blocks game on PCs that it has infected.While users play the game, the worm spends its time using the machine to search for new victims to infect on nearby networks.When it infects a machine, Cellery installs a version of Tetris that users can play.The risk of infection by Cellery is thought to be very low as few copies of the worm have been found in the wild.At the same time the virus starts scouring networks for other vulnerable machines.As the game starts up the worm also starts a music file to accompany it.'}\n","***\n","torch.Size([1, 784])\n","torch.Size([784])\n"]}],"source":["L = 784\n","\n","def tokenize_function(ex):\n","  print(ex)\n","  print(\"***\")\n","  tokens = tokenizer(ex['article'], padding='max_length', truncation=True, max_length=L, return_tensors='pt')\n","  label = tokenizer(ex['summary'], padding='max_length', truncation=True, max_length=L, return_tensors='pt')\n","  print(tokens['attention_mask'].size())\n","  tokens['attention_mask'] = tokens['attention_mask'].flatten().to('cuda')\n","  tokens['input_ids'] = tokens['input_ids'].flatten().to('cuda')\n","  # print(label)\n","  tokens['labels'] = label['input_ids'].flatten().to('cuda')\n","  # tokens['target'] = \n","  return tokens\n","\n","# dataset = Dataset.from_dict(new_data)\n","\n","print('Tokenizing data.
